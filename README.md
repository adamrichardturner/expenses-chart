# Expenses Chart Component

This is a solution to the [Expenses chart component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt).

## Overview

In this Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind app, I dynamically present JSON chart data using Chart.js.

Bars are represented by the amount of spending, and the current day as per the user's locale is highlighted with a different colour bar.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart
